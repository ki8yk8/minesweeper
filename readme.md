# Mines 2.0

## Introduction

Have you ever played classic Minesweeper? This is the modern version where you get powerups to assist you.

`Each time you complete a level, you earn coins equal to the number of bomb in the game.`

With the coins collected, you can use one or more of the following powerups;

1. **Safe start**, your first move will never let you down,
2. **Mine detector** revelas one safe cell for you. And yes, you can complete the game by using just this powerup if you have enough coins,
3. **Radar pulse** reveals your neighbourhood,
4. **Extra life** lets you survive even if you hit a mine,
5. **Reveal cross** opens linear path vertically and horizontally.
